The Red Lightning Summoning Bead combined with the Enlightenment Blade! The base damage of the weapon was increased by 8%, there was additional lightning damage and an option to summon a red lightning bolt. There was no decrease in health penalty!

In addition, the red lightning bolt boasted superior power to general lightning. The damage was calculated in proportion to the total attack power and the probability of causing electric shock was also high. But the real strength of the red lightning bolt was separate.

[You have dealt 41,900 damage to the target!]

[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has summoned a red lightning bolt!]

Kwajik!

The difference was that the red lightning bolt was summoned from the sky. Unless the enemy had eyes on the top of the head, the enemy targeted by the Enlightenment Blade wouldn’t be able to cope with the red lightning.

Kwarururung!

A red lightning bolt crossed the grey sky.

Kuwaaaang!

It fell towards lightning rod Death Knight Kruger on the ground!

“...!!”

A light flashed in Kruger’s eye sockets as part of his bones cracked. It was the aftermath of the powerful explosion.

[You have dealt 195,600 damage to the target!]

[The target is caught in an electric shock for 1.2 seconds!]

‘Good!’

The red lightning struck in a narrow range. It only damaged a single target. In addition, the probability of it appearing was only ‘low.’ But it was better than nothing. No, it was a thousand times better. Since it was a skill attached to a myth rated weapon, there was no resource consumption and the strength was around 40% of the black flames.

Pajijik!

Clack! Clack clack!

Death Knight Kruger flinched as he was wrapped in sparks. It was the effects of the electric shock. From this point, the God Hands started their rampage with Mjolnir.

Peok!

Peok peok peok!

[God Hand (1) has dealt 3,110 damage to the target.]

[The Ultimate Enhanced Mjolnir has caused the target to stiffen for 0.3 seconds.]

[God Hand (2) has dealt 2,030 damage to the target.]

[The +7 Mjolnir (2) has caused the target to stiffen for 0.1 seconds.]

[The God Hand (4)...]

[The +7 Mjolnir (4)...]

...

A snowball effect that started from the one second of electric shock! Kruger was incapacitated. He wasn’t able to block the golden hammers constantly attacking his skull. It was the moment when Grid grabbed his victory.

“God Hands! It has been a long time since you’ve done this!”

The God Hands’ first and foremost role was to protect their master. Grid’s safety was the priority no matter the circumstances.  It was almost impossible for Grid to suppress the basic attribute despite ordering them to ‘attack the target.’ While the God Hands were attacking the target, they were ready to switch to protecting Grid if he was attacked.

This was a strength and weakness. Of course, this weakness could be overcome if Grid continued to command the God Hands in real time. But was it that easy? It was difficult to constantly renew the commands to the God Hands while dealing with the enemy in front of his eyes.

This was why the combination of God Hands and Mjolnir couldn’t be used properly in every raid. But that weakness was overcome at this moment. Thanks to the Red Lightning Summoning Bead attached to the Enlightenment Blade!

Puk!

Puk puk!

Grid was able to attack at least two times per second with the option effect of the Quick Gloves. He continued to beat up the rigid Kruger. He didn’t take a break at all. Together with Mjolnir, he bombarded Kruger with sword attacks. Then.

“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”

Kuoooooh!

He tried a combo. After a basic attack, he cancelled the recovery action and immediately linked a skill. It omitted some motions, making it possible for him to link skills and basic attacks faster. A large number of players did this skillfully, but Grid wasn’t familiar with it. It was the limit of Pagma’s Swordsmanship rather than Grid’s individual talent. Pagma’s Swordsmanship was difficult to mix basic attacks in because the skill development motion was too long. However, this weakness was overcome with Alex's Quick Gloves.

Cheook!

One step.

Puok!

A flurry of basic attacks.

Cheook!

Another step.

Puok!

Another flurry of basic attacks. Grid mixed in his basic attacks between the steps of Pagma’s Swordsmanship. This was possible thanks to the faster attack speed. The best part was something else.

[Alex's Quick Gloves have been released.]

[You have equipped the +8 Holy Light Gloves.]

Due to the target being stiffened, there was time for Grid to swap items. Once he used a skill, he could take off Alex's Quick Gloves which weren’t effective and use the Holy Light Gloves. 

“Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.”

Kuooooooh!

He had managed to overwhelm Yatan’s Servant Malacus in his beginning days with the separate skills. Even Death Knight Kruger felt an instinctive crisis.

Clack!

Clack clack!

Kruger struggled as he was hit. He wanted to move, but couldn’t get away from the God Hands constantly hitting him. Infinite stiffness. It was a fraudulent technique that could be mistaken as a bug if activated properly.

Pit!

Pipipipipit!

The energy blades raged.

Peng!

Pepepepeng!

Flames and black flames exploded in succession. After that.

Kurururung!

Red lightning fell from the sky and struck Kruger’s skull.

Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!

...

...

“Kiyaaaaah!”

In the ensuing explosion and lightning strikes, Kruger’s voice filled the sky. It was a roar of anger, not pain. It was because he couldn’t feel pain. However, Grid’s attack wasn’t over. This was only the Link part of Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle. The real attack started now.

Puk.

Puk puk! Puuoook!

The energy blades aiming at Kruger changed their orbits, this time moving in a straight line. Kruger was pierced by it and his purple light turned grey. It seemed that all activities stopped for a while due to the excessive impact.

[You have dealt 310,100 damage to the target!]

[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has summoned a red lightning bolt!]

Kwarung!

Kwarururung!

A natural disaster wouldn’t be as hard as this. The endlessly swirling attacks struck Kruger. Grid felt sympathy since this was also a person who fought for the world as a legend.

“Ah... Ahhh...”

Duguen! Duguen!

Sticks was pale as he watched through the crystal ball. He was amazed beyond admiration at Grid’s absurd aggressiveness. He was so surprised that he could feel a pain in his weak heart. Grid’s strikes continued. The storm of death turned Kruger into rags and then Pinnacle descended. A powerful blow!

Jjejejeok!

Kruger’s skull was heavily cracked. As soon as Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle was completed, Grid replaced the Holy Light Gloves with Alex’s Quick Gloves and immediately started hitting Kruger with basic attacks.

‘He is really durable.’

Kruger still had 30% of his health remaining. Grid grumbled, but a named boss had lost 70% of his health from one skill. It was truly shocking. It meant that Grid’s attack power was outside a player’s range and was on the level of a catastrophe.

“Pagma’s Swordsmanship!”

Grid prepared the final blow. After a basic attack, he swapped the Quick Gloves to the Holy Light Gloves. Then.

“Linked Kill!”

Puk.

Puk puk puk!

Grid stabbed Death Knight Kruger again! The 5th strike wasn’t a critical and it felt somewhat lacking, but he didn’t try transforming the God Hands into Lifael’s Spear. It was because the moment a Mjolnir was lost, Kruger might escape from the infinite stiffness and fight back. It was a very wise decision.

‘There is no need to fret.’

The prey was already caught so there was no need to worry about finishing the battle quickly. The key was keeping the infinite stiffness. Grid thought this and after Linked Kill, he used Transcended Link, Pinnacle Kill, and Link. He was able to trigger two Pinnacle Kills thanks to God's Command activating.

In the end.

Kurururu!

It took 10 minutes but Kruger, the guardian of the 63rd island was killed. He wasn’t able to use the unknown item that he spent 20 minutes making. It was because he was weak to status conditions, becoming good prey for the God Hands and Mjolnir combination.

[You have defeated Death Knight Kruger, guardian of the 63rd island!]

[The 63rd island has been cleansed!]

[As a reward for cleansing the island, you have gained one level!]

[You have acquired Kruger’s tailoring tools!]

[You have acquired Kruger’s Mysterious Cloth!]
